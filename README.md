# ⚽ This repository is especially for you who need some help about HaxBall Room Scrips

Some of the Scripts are basic, but very functional. I assure you that it will take you no more than 15 minutes to edit most of them.

## 🔧 Getting Started
If you are interested in using this bot, you need to know a few things!

- To use these scripts, you need a bot for a HaxBall room.
